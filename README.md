Our approach to this challenge
---------

```
As a user
So I can store my thoughts
I want to be able to write messages on a webapp
```

```
As a user
So I can see what my old thoughts were
I want to be able to see a message history 
```

```
As a user
So I don't get confused about when I had these thoughts
I want to see a timestamp with my messages
```

* After receiving our user stories, we began with diagramming & modelling what information we were given, as well as thinking about initial tests which would form our BDD process
